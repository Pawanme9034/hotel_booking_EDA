Name - Pawan Kumar Singh

Project Summary -
This project is related to Hotel Booking Analysis.

In this project we divide EDA in several steps, like

know your data,

Understanding your Variables

Data Wrangling

Data Vizualization, Storytelling & Experimenting with charts : Understand the relationships between variables

Solution to Business Objective

Conclusion

In this dataset we having two hotel types i.e City Hotel and Resort Hotel.

In this dataset contains total rows 119390 and 32 columns.

As Further moved i.e know your data,first step to find different columns which is done by coding Head(),info(), describe(), columns() and some others methods.some of the columns name is hotel,is_canceled,lead_time,arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month,arrival_date_week_number,arrival_date_day_of_month,stays_in_weekend_nights.

As we further moved we find unique value of each columns and generate a list in tabular form and also check the dataset type of each columnsâ€™ find some columns not in accurate data types which corrected it later done in Data Wrangling part and as well as duplicates data items must be removed as we find duplicates items.The dataset contains 31994 duplicate rows.Unique row - 87396 for that, we are checked the null value of all the columns. After checking, 'company' colume have 93.98% null values. so we drop the column When we are find minimal number of null values, filling thse null values with necesary values as per requirement by using .fillna().Different charts are used for data visualization so that better insights and Business objective is attained.

What all manipulations have you done and insights you found?
We have done few manipulations in the Data.

1. Delete of columns

a)company: this columns has almost 93.98% Null data. so deleting this column will not make any impact in the analysis.

2. Removed is_null values & duplicate entries

a) filling the null values with necesary values as per requirement by using .fillna().

1. there is minimul null values in agent, so we will replace null from 0 
2. there are less null vlues in 'children' colunm, so replace null from 0
3. ther are less null vlues in country colunm, so replace null from 'others' because 'country' colunm dtype is object type.

b) there are few rows have duplicate data. So removed those row from data set by using .drop_duplicates() method.

3.Addition of columns

a) Total Guests: This columns will help to evaluate the volumes of total guest and revenue as well. geting this value by adding total no. of Adults, Children & babies.

b) Revenue: find revenue by multiplying adr & total guest. This column will use to analyse the profit and growth of each hotel.

c) 'is_canceled_flot64': for convating is_canceled datatype values in int64 to flot64.

4. Replace of Values in columns

a)is_repeated_guest:column 'is_repeated_guest',replace 0,1 from 'Repeated' & 'Not repeated'. Now this values will help to make better understanding while visulization.

----Changes in data type of values in columns----

a)Agent & Children: these columns contains float values, which is not making any sense in data as this values repreasent the count of guest & ID of agent. So we have changed the data type of these columns from 'float' to 'Integer'.

In this way, removed unneccesary data & make our data clean and ready to analyse.

3. Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?
Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.

The insights gained from the analysis of hotel booking data can help create a positive business impact in several ways.

Firstly, by understanding the distribution of booking dates and check-in/check-out dates, hotels can better plan their staffing, inventory, and pricing strategies to optimize their occupancy rates and revenue.

Secondly, by identifying the most popular booking channels, hotels can focus their marketing efforts on those channels and tailor their messaging to reach their target audience.

However, there are also some insights that could lead to negative growth if not addressed properly. For example, the fact that the cancellation rate for city hotels is higher than for resort hotels could indicate that customers have different expectations for these types of hotels, or that there are issues with the booking process or customer service at city hotels. If city hotels do not address these issues, they may see a decline in customer satisfaction and bookings over time.

Overall, the insights gained from the analysis of hotel booking data can have a positive business impact if they are used to inform strategic decisions and improve the customer experience. However, it is important to address any potential negative impacts as well to ensure long-term growth and success.

2. What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
TA/TO(Tour of Agent & Tour of operator) is most preferable channel for booking. ta/to-79.1%, direct-14.5.8%, corporate - 5.6%, undefined- 0.0% and GDS- 0.2%.

3. Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?
Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.

The insight that TA/TO is the most preferable channel for hotel bookings can help create a positive business impact, as hotels can focus their marketing efforts and partnerships on these channels to increase their bookings and revenue. They can also tailor their messaging and promotions to appeal to customers who prefer these channels.need to improve 'Direct' channel. Higher the number of Direct channel will help to increase the revenue generation of Hotel.

Moreover, the insight that direct bookings account for a relatively small percentage of bookings could lead hotels to reconsider their direct booking strategies and invest in marketing campaigns and loyalty programs to incentivize customers to book directly with the hotel.

However, there is a potential negative impact associated with relying heavily on TA/TO for bookings. If the hotel is too dependent on these channels, it may be at risk of losing revenue if the market shifts or if there are disruptions to these channels. Additionally, hotels may have to pay commissions to the agents or operators, which can affect their profitability.

Overall, while the insight that TA/TO is the most preferable channel for bookings can be positive for the hotel, it is important to consider potential negative impacts and to diversify booking channels to minimize risks and maximize revenue.

The hotel can use this information to tailor their marketing efforts to attract more guests from Portugal. They could also consider hiring staff who speak Portuguese to better accommodate guests from this market segment.

However, there could be insights that lead to negative growth. If the hotel becomes too reliant on guests from Portugal, they may be vulnerable to changes in the economic or political climate of that country.

Overall, while the insight that the Online TA market segment is most frequently used by guests can provide valuable information to the hotel, it is important to consider the potential negative impacts and take steps to diversify the hotel's distribution channels to avoid over-reliance on any single channel.

3. Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?
Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.

The insight that the average ADR of City hotel is higher than that of Resort hotel suggests that the City hotel is likely to generate more revenue and profit than the Resort hotel. This information could be used by the business to make decisions about where to allocate resources and focus marketing efforts. For example, the City hotel may want to invest more in advertising and promotions to attract more customers and increase its revenue.

However, it's important to note that this insight alone may not be enough to guarantee a positive business impact. Other factors such as occupancy rates, marketing strategies, and customer satisfaction also play a significant role in determining the success of a hotel business.

Regarding negative growth, there may be insights that lead to negative growth if they indicate that the business is performing poorly or facing significant challenges. For example, if a hotel has low customer satisfaction scores or high employee turnover rates, these could be indicators of underlying problems that could lead to negative growth in the future. It's important to carefully consider all insights and take action to address any potential issues before they impact the business.

1. Why did you pick the specific chart?
To show how ADR affect cancelation

2. What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?
The correlation between ADR and cancellations is positive which means as ADR increases number of booking cancellations will also be increases.

The insights gained from the correlation between ADR and cancellations can help create a positive business impact if used appropriately. For example, if the analysis reveals that high ADRs are associated with high cancellation rates, a hotel manager could take steps to reduce cancellations, such as improving the hotel's cancellation policies, offering more attractive packages or deals, or improving the customer service experience to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Moreover, if the insights gained from the analysis reveal a strong negative correlation between ADR and cancellations, this may lead to negative growth as well. In this case, if the hotel management decides to decrease the ADRs of the rooms to reduce cancellations, it may result in decreased revenue and profits in the long term, which could have a negative impact on the business.

Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the insights gained from the analysis and make informed decisions based on the data to create a positive business impact.

The insight that a very less number of guests require parking spaces may not necessarily have a direct positive or negative impact on business growth. However, it can still be useful for hotel management to optimize their parking space utilization and potentially reduce costs associated with maintaining unused parking spaces. On the other hand, if a hotel is experiencing high demand for parking spaces but does not have enough available, this could lead to a negative impact on customer satisfaction and potentially result in lost business.

3. Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?
Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.

Yes, the gained insights can potentially help create a positive business impact. Let's break it down:

Total guest and ADR (Average Daily Rate) being highly correlated means that as the total number of guests increases, the ADR also tends to increase. This can indicate that the business is able to attract a higher number of guests at a higher rate, which can lead to increased revenue and profitability.

Total guest and previous booking not canceled having a negative correlation means that as the total number of guests increases, the number of previous bookings that were not canceled tends to decrease. This may indicate that there could be cancellations or no-shows from previous bookings, which can impact revenue and result in lost business opportunities. This insight can help the business identify areas for improvement in managing bookings and reducing cancellations, which could lead to increased revenue.

Previous booking not canceled and previous cancellation being positively correlated means that as the number of previous bookings that were not canceled increases, the number of previous cancellations also tends to increase. This may indicate that the business has a higher rate of cancellations despite bookings not being canceled. This insight can help the business identify potential issues with their cancellation policies, customer service, or booking management processes, and take corrective actions to reduce cancellations and improve guest retention.

However, it's important to note that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. These insights provide valuable information for identifying patterns and trends, but further analysis and investigation would be needed to establish causality and understand the underlying reasons behind the correlations.

Insights that could lead to negative growth would be those that highlight areas of concern or weaknesses in the business processes or operations.

1. Why did you pick the specific chart?
The pairplot chart is a good choice to visualize the pairwise relationships between multiple variables in a dataset. This chart shows scatter plots for each combination of variables along the diagonal, and kernel density estimates for each variable on the diagonal, making it easy to visualize both the distribution of each variable and the relationships between them.

2. What is the insight found from the chart?
Based on the dataset, the following insights can be obtained from a pair plot:

'lead_time' vs 'stays_in_weekend_nights': The pair plot can show if there is any relationship between the lead time (number of days between booking date and arrival date) and the number of weekend nights stayed by the guests. It can help identify if there is any seasonality or trend in bookings made in advance and weekend stays.

'lead_time' vs 'stays_in_week_nights': The pair plot can show if there is any relationship between the lead time and the number of weekday nights stayed by the guests. It can help identify if there is any seasonality or trend in bookings made in advance and weekday stays.

'lead_time' vs 'adr' (average daily rate): The pair plot can show if there is any relationship between the lead time and the average daily rate. It can help identify if guests booking in advance tend to get different rates compared to last-minute bookings.

'stays_in_weekend_nights' vs 'adr': The pair plot can show if there is any relationship between the number of weekend nights stayed and the average daily rate. It can help identify if there are any trends in pricing for weekend stays.

'stays_in_week_nights' vs 'adr': The pair plot can show if there is any relationship between the number of weekday nights stayed and the average daily rate. It can help identify if there are any trends in pricing for weekday stays.

'stays_in_weekend_nights' vs 'stays_in_week_nights': The pair plot can show if there is any relationship between the number of weekend nights stayed and the number of weekday nights stayed. It can help identify if guests tend to stay for more weekend nights compared to weekday nights, or vice versa.

'adr' vs 'is_canceled': The pair plot can show if there is any relationship between the average daily rate and the cancellation status of the bookings. It can help identify if there are any differences in pricing for canceled and non-canceled bookings.

'stays_in_weekend_nights' vs 'is_canceled': The pair plot can show if there is any relationship between the number of weekend nights stayed and the cancellation status of the bookings. It can help identify if there are any differences in cancellation rates for weekend stays compared to weekday stays.

'stays_in_week_nights' vs 'is_canceled': The pair plot can show if there is any relationship between the number of weekday nights stayed and the cancellation status of the bookings. It can help identify if there are any differences in cancellation rates for weekday stays compared to weekend stays.

'lead_time' vs 'is_canceled': The pair plot can show if there is any relationship between the lead time and the cancellation status of the bookings. It can help identify if bookings made in advance have different cancellation rates compared to last-minute bookings.

These are some of the insights that can be obtained from a pair plot using the variables provided in the dataset. However, the actual insights may vary depending on the data and the specific characteristics of the dataset. It is important to analyze the pair plot in conjunction with other exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and statistical analysis to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data.

3. Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?
Are there any insights that lead to negative growth? Justify with specific reason.

Yes, the insights gained from data analytics can certainly help create a positive business impact. Data analytics can provide valuable information and insights that can be used to make informed decisions, optimize processes, identify new opportunities, improve customer experiences, and drive overall business performance. By leveraging data analytics effectively, businesses can gain a competitive advantage and achieve positive outcomes, such as increased revenue, improved profitability, enhanced operational efficiency, and better customer satisfaction.

However, it's important to note that not all insights derived from data analytics will necessarily lead to positive business outcomes. There are certain scenarios where insights may result in negative growth or unfavorable outcomes. For example:

Identifying Ineffective Strategies: Data analytics may reveal that certain business strategies or initiatives are not yielding the desired results or are not aligned with market trends or customer preferences. This could lead to negative growth if corrective actions are not taken to address the issues identified.

Uncovering Operational Inefficiencies: Data analytics may uncover operational inefficiencies or bottlenecks that are impacting productivity or increasing costs. Addressing these inefficiencies may require investments in process improvements, technology upgrades, or other changes, which could initially impact the bottom line before generating positive returns.

Identifying Customer Dissatisfaction: Data analytics may reveal patterns of customer dissatisfaction, such as poor product performance, negative feedback, or declining customer retention rates. If these issues are not addressed promptly, they may result in negative growth, as dissatisfied customers may switch to competitors or share their negative experiences with others, leading to reputational damage.

Unforeseen Market Changes: Data analytics may uncover unforeseen changes in market dynamics, such as shifting consumer preferences, competitive pressures, regulatory changes, or other external factors that may impact business performance. If not addressed appropriately, these changes may result in negative growth or even business disruption.

In summary, while data analytics can provide valuable insights to drive positive business outcomes, it's important to carefully evaluate and act upon the insights to avoid any potential negative impacts. Timely actions, appropriate strategies, and effective execution are crucial to ensure that insights gained from data analytics lead to positive business impacts.
